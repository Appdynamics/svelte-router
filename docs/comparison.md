# Comparison

## Key difference

One main feature most routers don't have is a global route store. Most routers require the route data to be manually passed via props or use [context](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) which only works in components.

I have however found one library, [yrv](https://github.com/pateketrueke/yrv) to have a properly implemented global route store, but I could not get it to work with Vite.

Besides, this router also exposes `createLink`, which allows users to easily get information of the link's href and if is active, useful for creating anchor tags too.
